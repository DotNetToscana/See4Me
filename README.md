# Introducing See4Me

*See4Me* is a cross-platform app to 'see' the world using [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services). Simply point the smartphone and tap: in a few instants the app will describe and speak what it sees -- from scenes to objects to people with age and emotion. The app is also able to automatically translate descriptions using [Microsoft Translator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/products.aspx).

**Getting started**

First, you must obtain a Cognitive API subscription keys by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). Then, you also need to subscribe to [Microsoft Translator Service](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/apitype/TextTranslation) on Azure.

You need to insert these service keys (Subscription Key for Vision, Face, Emotion and Translator Services) in the *Src/See4Me.Shared/ServiceKeys.cs* file.
